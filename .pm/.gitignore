# ===============
# Runtime files that should NOT be committed.
# data.json and config.toml ARE tracked (not listed here = tracked).

# SQLite database (local performance — use data.json for git sync)
# Binary files cannot be merged by git. Two developers editing work items
# independently produces an unresolvable binary conflict.
data.db

# Negate root .gitignore's *.json pattern if one exists
!data.json

# Installed binaries (downloaded via install.sh or built locally)
bin/

# SQLite WAL/SHM runtime files (recreated automatically on server start)
*.db-wal
*.db-shm

# Server discovery file (ephemeral — changes every server start)
server.json

# Process lock file (prevents duplicate server instances)
server.lock

# Server log files
