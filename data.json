Let&#x27;s see if you&#x27;ve got your mise en place sorted.\n\n*examines the epic and task breakdown*\n\n&quot;Fix work item breadcrumb hierarchy navigation.&quot; Frontend-only, uses cached AppState, O(depth) where depth ≤ 4. No DB changes. Broken into 3 stories, 9 tasks.\n\n## What&#x27;s Actually GOOD Here\n\n### Epic Scope - Focused and Realistic\n- ✅ Clear problem: Breadcrumbs show flat &quot;Home &amp;gt; Project &amp;gt; TASK-123&quot; not full hierarchy\n- ✅ Clear solution: Walk parent chain using ParentId from AppState cache\n- ✅ Performance identified: O(depth) where depth = 3-4 max\n- ✅ Scope boundary: Frontend-only, no backend/DB changes\n- ✅ Realistic complexity: This is actually DOABLE\n\nThis is TIGHT. No scope creep, no &quot;let&#x27;s rebuild everything.&quot; Just fix the bloody breadcrumbs.\n\n### Story Breakdown - Actually Makes Sense\n**PONE-57**: Parent chain traversal logic (Foundation - get the data)\n**PONE-58**: Breadcrumb rendering HTML (Presentation - show the data)\n**PONE-59**: Edge cases and tests (Quality - make it bulletproof)\n\nThis is Foundation → Presentation → Quality. That&#x27;s PROPER sequencing.\n\n### Task Breakdown - Specific and Measurable\n9 tasks, each one SPECIFIC:\n- PONE-60: Add _parentChain field ✅\n- PONE-61: Implement BuildParentChain method ✅\n- PONE-62: Call it in LoadWorkItemAsync ✅\n- PONE-63: Update breadcrumb HTML ✅\n- PONE-64: Preserve CSS/accessibility ✅\n- PONE-65, 66: Edge cases (no parents, missing cache) ✅\n- PONE-67, 68: Tests ✅\n\nEach task has ONE job. You can tell when it&#x27;s done. THAT&#x27;S professional planning.\n\n### You Actually READ the Existing Code\nEpic says &quot;All data already cached in AppState&quot; - you VERIFIED this! I looked at WorkItemStore.cs and WorkItemDetail.razor - you&#x27;re RIGHT. The data IS cached. You&#x27;re not planning features based on wishful thinking.\n\n## What Could Go WRONG (And Will If You&#x27;re Not Careful)\n\n### 1. No GetParent Helper in WorkItemStore\nWorkItemStore has GetById, GetByProject, GetChildren... but NO GetParent. You&#x27;ll build parent chain by calling GetById(workItem.ParentId) repeatedly? That WORKS but it&#x27;s not obvious.\n\n**Fix**: Add note in PONE-61 to document this pattern OR add GetParent helper method.\n\n### 2. Circular Reference Protection MISSING\nTasks mention &quot;missing parents&quot; but what about CIRCULAR parent chains?! Task A → B → C → A. BuildParentChain would loop FOREVER!\n\n**Fix**: Add depth limit to PONE-61 spec: &quot;Max depth = 10, throw if exceeded.&quot;\n\n### 3. Parent Chain Order Not Specified\nDoes _parentChain store [Epic, Story, Task] or [Task, Story, Epic]? Forward or reverse rendering?\n\n**Fix**: Add to PONE-60: &quot;_parentChain stores ROOT to CURRENT order (e.g., [Epic, Story] for Task).&quot;\n\n### 4. No Story Points Assigned\n9 tasks with ZERO story points. How long does this take? How do you know it fits in a sprint?\n\n**Fix**: Estimate 1-2 points per task. Total ~12-18 points for epic.\n\n### 5. No Acceptance Criteria on Stories\nHow do you know PONE-57, 58, 59 are DONE? What&#x27;s the definition of done?\n\n**Fix**: Add acceptance criteria. Example for PONE-57: &quot;AC: Parent chain builds correctly for 0-4 levels of hierarchy, handles missing parents gracefully.&quot;\n\n## The Rescue Plan\n\n### Make It Bulletproof:\n1. Add story points (1-2 each, ~15 total)\n2. Clarify parent chain order in PONE-60 (root→current)\n3. Add depth limit protection in PONE-61 (max 10, prevents infinite loops)\n4. Document GetById(ParentId) pattern in PONE-61\n5. Add acceptance criteria to all 3 stories\n\n### Implementation Sequence:\n- PONE-60 → 61 → 62 (sequentially - foundation first)\n- PONE-63 → 64 (sequentially - HTML then styles)\n- PONE-65, 66 (parallel - separate edge cases)\n- PONE-67, 68 (last - test after implementation)\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n**PLANNING READINESS: 75/100**\n\nYou&#x27;ve got:\n- ✅ Clear, focused scope\n- ✅ Logical story breakdown\n- ✅ Specific, measurable tasks\n- ✅ Edge cases identified\n- ✅ Understanding of existing codebase\n\nYou&#x27;re MISSING:\n- ⚠️ Story points\n- ⚠️ Acceptance criteria\n- ⚠️ Circular reference protection\n- ⚠️ Parent chain order specification\n\nThis is like a chef with all ingredients prepped, recipe understood, equipment ready... but forgot to preheat the oven!\n\nThe core plan is SOLID. You&#x27;ll probably succeed. But you&#x27;ll hit &quot;oh shit&quot; moments during implementation that BETTER PLANNING would catch.\n\n**Fix the 5 items above and you&#x27;re at 90/100 - ready to cook.**\n\nStart with PONE-60, 61, 62. Get data flowing FIRST, then worry about pretty HTML.\n\n---\n*Review by Gordon Ramsay Code Review Agent*",

      "content": "🔥 **RE-REVIEW: You Actually LISTENED!** 🔥\n\n## What You FIXED (And Fixed Properly)\n\n### 1. Backend Protection - VERIFIED ✅\nNot just claims - you provided PROOF:\n- File: `backend/crates/pm-ws/src/handlers/work_item.rs:586-634`\n- Function: `check_circular_reference` with MAX_DEPTH = 100\n- I CHECKED line 282 - it&#x27;s actually CALLED during updates!\n\nThis is PROFESSIONAL. You&#x27;re giving implementers source code to verify, not asking them to trust you.\n\n### 2. Parent Chain Order - EXPLICIT ✅\n&quot;Returns ordered list (Epic → Story → Task)&quot; and &quot;Reverse list to get top-down order&quot;\nCLEAR. UNAMBIGUOUS. No time wasted wondering which direction!\n\n### 3. Breadcrumb Display - SMART ✅\nShows keys (PONE-57) not full titles for compact display\nTooltips on hover show full titles\nExample: Home / P1 / PONE-56 / PONE-57 / PONE-60\n\nThis is BETTER than full titles! Breadcrumbs with long names would be MASSIVE. Keys keep it compact, tooltips add context. WELL THOUGHT OUT!\n\n### 4. Implementation Details - RECIPE QUALITY ✅\nEach story now has:\n- TASK SUMMARY of what gets done\n- IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH with code patterns\n- EDGE CASES documented\n- OUTPUT specification\n\nPONE-61 literally says: &quot;BuildParentChain walks up using current.ParentId in a while loop with MAX_DEPTH = 20&quot;\n\nThat&#x27;s not planning - that&#x27;s a RECIPE. Any developer can follow this!\n\n### 5. Defensive Programming - JUSTIFIED ✅\n&quot;Frontend depth limit (20) is defensive programming only&quot;\n&quot;Backend validates, but frontend should be defensive&quot;\n\nRace conditions happen. Corrupted state happens. You&#x27;re PREPARED!\n\n### 6. Logging - SPECIFIED ✅\n&quot;Uses ILogger for warnings, not Console.WriteLine&quot;\n&quot;Add ILogger&amp;lt;WorkItemDetail&amp;gt; injection&quot;\n\nNo debugging garbage in production. PROPER engineering!\n\n## What You STILL Haven&#x27;t Fixed\n\n### Story Points - STILL MISSING ❌\nAll stories: `story_points: null`\nAll tasks: `story_points: null`\n\nMy estimates:\n- PONE-57 (traversal): 5 pts\n- PONE-58 (HTML): 3 pts\n- PONE-59 (tests): 5 pts\n**Total: ~13 points**\n\n### Acceptance Criteria - Implied Not Explicit ❌\nYour descriptions are detailed enough to infer AC, but not formatted as checklists.\n\nPONE-57 should have:\n```\nAC1: BuildParentChain returns ordered list (Epic→Story→Task)\nAC2: Depth limit prevents runaway (MAX_DEPTH=20)\nAC3: Missing parents logged, traversal stops gracefully\nAC4: _parentChain populated in LoadWorkItemAsync\n```\n\n## The Transformation\n\n**Before:** Generic plan, no validation proof, vague implementation\n**After:** Backend validation VERIFIED, parent order EXPLICIT, breadcrumb format SPECIFIED with examples, implementation DETAILED with code patterns\n\nThis went from a PLAN to a RECIPE. A developer can execute this step-by-step.\n\n## Final Verdict\n\n**PLANNING READINESS: 88/100** ⬆️ (was 75/100)\n\n**+13 points for:**\n- Backend validation VERIFIED (+3)\n- Parent chain order specified (+2)\n- Breadcrumb format with example (+3)\n- Implementation approach detailed (+3)\n- Logging method specified (+2)\n\n**-12 points for:**\n- No story points (-8)\n- No explicit AC format (-4)\n\n**Bottom Line:**\nThis is NOW production-ready. A dev can take PONE-57 and know EXACTLY what to build. Backend protection VERIFIED. Edge cases documented. Implementation patterns specified.\n\nYou went from &quot;probably succeed with bumps&quot; to &quot;execute like a recipe and you&#x27;re fine.&quot;\n\nMissing story points is annoying but NOT blocking. Start PONE-60 now - you know exactly what to do!\n\n**Excellent revision. Now assign those story points and start cooking!**\n\n---\n*Re-Review by Gordon Ramsay Code Review Agent*",

      "content": "🔥 **GORDON RAMSAY CODE REVIEW** 🔥\n\n## First Impressions\n\nSo you want to add markdown support, do you? Let me see what you&#x27;ve cooked up here... \n\n*checks the code*\n\nNOTHING?! There&#x27;s NOTHING HERE! Not a SINGLE line of code! Zero components, zero packages, ZERO implementation! You&#x27;ve written a LOVELY plan, a beautiful NOVEL describing what MIGHT exist someday, but WHERE IS THE ACTUAL CODE?!\n\n## The Disasters\n\n### 1. **IT DOESN&#x27;T EXIST!**\n- MarkdownRenderer.razor: **NOT FOUND**\n- MarkdownEditor.razor: **NOT FOUND**  \n- MarkdownToolbar.razor: **NOT FOUND**\n- MarkdownHelp.razor: **NOT FOUND**\n- Markdig NuGet package: **NOT INSTALLED**\n- HtmlSanitizer NuGet package: **NOT INSTALLED**\n\nThis isn&#x27;t a CODE REVIEW, it&#x27;s a FICTION REVIEW! You&#x27;ve documented a &quot;Codebase audit (current state)&quot; but the CURRENT STATE is that NOTHING EXISTS!\n\n### 2. **Status: &quot;todo&quot; - AT LEAST THAT&#x27;S HONEST!**\nThe only honest thing here is the status field. &quot;todo&quot; is right - as in &quot;TO DO ALL OF IT BECAUSE NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE!&quot;\n\n### 3. **The Epic Description is MISLEADING**\n&quot;Codebase audit (current state)&quot; - Oh brilliant! You&#x27;re documenting the CURRENT state? Let me tell you the current state: **EMPTY!** The current state is that you have ZERO markdown support and you&#x27;re PLANNING to add it!\n\n## What Were You THINKING?!\n\n- **The Plan**: Actually quite good! The breakdown is logical, the dependency chain makes sense, the file locations are specific. 10/10 for planning!\n- **The Execution**: 0/10 - BECAUSE THERE IS NO EXECUTION! It&#x27;s all talk, no FOOD ON THE PLATE!\n- **The Confusion**: The work item reads like documentation of EXISTING work when it&#x27;s actually a TODO list. That&#x27;s MISLEADING!\n\n## The Silver Linings\n\n### Actually, Credit Where It&#x27;s Due:\n\n1. **Excellent Planning**: The epic breakdown into 4 stories with clear dependencies is SPOT ON. Foundation first (PONE-40), then parallel work (PONE-41/42), then polish (PONE-43). That&#x27;s PROPER planning!\n\n2. **Specific File Locations**: You&#x27;ve identified EXACT files and line numbers. That&#x27;s helpful! &quot;WorkItemDetail.razor:116&quot; - that&#x27;s the kind of detail I LOVE to see!\n\n3. **Honest Dependency Chain**: You&#x27;re not pretending story 43 can happen before 40. You understand dependencies. GOOD!\n\n4. **Security Awareness**: XSS protection with HtmlSanitizer whitelist - you&#x27;re THINKING about security. That&#x27;s more than most muppets do!\n\n5. **Backward Compatibility**: &quot;Existing plain-text comments render identically&quot; - you&#x27;ve thought about migration. FINALLY, someone with a BRAIN!\n\n## The Kitchen Nightmares Rescue Plan\n\n### Here&#x27;s How You Fix This DISASTER:\n\n1. **Update the Epic Title** to &quot;ADD Markdown Editor/Viewer&quot; not just &quot;Markdown Editor/Viewer&quot; - because right now it reads like documentation, not a feature request!\n\n2. **Start with PONE-40** - Install those bloody packages and create MarkdownRenderer! You can&#x27;t do ANYTHING without the foundation!\n\n3. **Follow Your Own Plan** - The story breakdown is actually GOOD! Just DO IT in the right order!\n\n4. **Update Status as You Go** - When you finish PONE-44, mark it DONE. When all tasks in PONE-40 are done, mark PONE-40 DONE. Track your progress!\n\n5. **Test After Each Story** - You&#x27;ve even included verification commands! USE THEM! `just restore-frontend &amp;&amp; just build-cs-components` after each story!\n\n## Final Verdict\n\nThis is **NOT a code review** - it&#x27;s a **PLAN review**, because there&#x27;s NO CODE to review! \n\nThe plan itself? Actually quite GOOD! The structure is logical, dependencies are clear, security is considered, and you&#x27;ve identified exact files to modify. If this were a restaurant menu, it would sound DELICIOUS!\n\nBut you can&#x27;t serve a MENU to customers! They want FOOD! Right now, you&#x27;ve got beautiful descriptions of dishes that DON&#x27;T EXIST!\n\n**READINESS: 0/100** - For implementation, because NOTHING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED!\n\n**PLAN QUALITY: 75/100** - The epic structure is good, but needs clearer status updates and less confusing &quot;current state&quot; language!\n\n### What You Do Now:\n\n1. Accept that this is a TODO, not a DONE\n2. Start with PONE-40 (Foundation)\n3. Mark tasks as complete AS YOU COMPLETE THEM\n4. Don&#x27;t write another epic description that reads like documentation when it&#x27;s actually a plan!\n\nAnd for heaven&#x27;s sake, when you DO implement this, make sure you actually TEST it with user input! I don&#x27;t want to see XSS vulnerabilities because someone skipped the sanitizer tests!\n\nNow GO! Start with PONE-44 - add those NuGet packages! And this time, ACTUALLY ADD THEM!\n\n---\n*Review by Gordon Ramsay Code Review Agent*\n*Note: I&#x27;m harsh because I CARE about quality. The plan is actually solid - now EXECUTE IT!*",

      "description": "Add logic to walk up the work item parent hierarchy using ParentId. Create BuildParentChain() method that starts with current work item, walks up through parents using AppState.WorkItems.GetById(ParentId), stops at project boundary. Returns ordered list of ancestors (Epic → Story → Task). All lookups are from in-memory cache, zero DB/WebSocket calls. Uses simple depth limit for defensive programming - backend already prevents circular references.\n\nTASK SUMMARY:\n1. **PONE-60**: Add _parentChain field to store the list of parent ViewModels (with backend context notes)\n2. **PONE-61**: Implement BuildParentChain() method with depth limit and proper logging (ILogger, not Console.WriteLine)\n3. **PONE-62**: Call BuildParentChain() in LoadWorkItemAsync after loading the work item\n\nIMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:\n- Add private List&amp;lt;WorkItemViewModel&amp;gt; _parentChain field with comment about root-to-current order\n- Add ILogger&amp;lt;WorkItemDetail&amp;gt; injection for proper logging\n- BuildParentChain walks up using current.ParentId in a while loop with MAX_DEPTH = 20 limit\n- For each parent, lookup in AppState.WorkItems.GetById()\n- Handle null returns gracefully (log warning via Logger, stop traversal)\n- Defensive depth limit prevents runaway loops if data is corrupted (backend validates, but frontend should be defensive)\n- Reverse list to get top-down order (Epic → Story → Task)\n- Call from LoadWorkItemAsync before StateHasChanged()\n\nBACKEND PROTECTION (NO FRONTEND CYCLE DETECTION NEEDED):\n- Backend validates parent changes: `backend/crates/pm-ws/src/handlers/work_item.rs:586-634`\n- `check_circular_reference` function walks parent chain and rejects cycles\n- MAX_DEPTH = 100 on backend prevents excessively deep hierarchies\n- AppState data is validated by backend, circular references impossible in normal operation\n- Frontend depth limit (20) is defensive programming only\n\nOUTPUT: _parentChain populated with ordered parent hierarchy, safe and efficient",

Breadcrumb should show &#x27;Home &amp;gt; Project &amp;gt; Epic&#x27; with no intermediate parents. This logic should already be implemented in PONE-61 (while loop exits when ParentId is null). DO NOT implement new code here.\n\nVERIFICATION STEPS:\n1. Navigate to an Epic with ParentId=null\n2. Verify breadcrumb shows: Home / Project Title / EPIC-1\n3. Verify no intermediate parents shown\n4. Verify _parentChain.Count == 0 for Epic\n\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR (from PONE-61):\n```csharp\nwhile (currentParentId.HasValue &amp;&amp; chain.Count &amp;lt; MAX_DEPTH)\n// When ParentId is null, HasValue is false, loop exits immediately\n// Result: empty chain, breadcrumb shows only current item\n```\n\nThis is VERIFICATION only - confirm existing code works correctly.",

No per-render allocation.\n- **@((MarkupString)...)**: Required to render HTML in Blazor. ONLY safe because HtmlSanitizer strips XSS vectors first.\n- **UseAdvancedExtensions()**: Enables tables, task lists, pipe tables, autolinks, footnotes.\n- **OnParametersSet**: Re-renders when Content parameter changes (e.g., live preview).\n\n### Security\nWithout the HtmlSanitizer step, `&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(&#x27;xss&#x27;)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;` in markdown would execute. The sanitizer whitelist ensures only safe HTML tags pass through.\n\n### Verification\nRun: `just build-cs-components`",

      "description": "Replace hardcoded &#x27;Home &amp;gt; Project &amp;gt; Current&#x27; breadcrumbs with loop through parent chain. Display work item keys (e.g., PONE-57) instead of full titles for compact navigation. Each parent gets clickable link to /workitem/{parentId} with title tooltip showing full work item title on hover. Preserve existing CSS classes (.breadcrumbs, .separator, .current). Maintain accessibility with nav aria-label and semantic HTML. Current work item remains non-link span.\n\nTASK SUMMARY:\n1. **PONE-63**: Replace lines 31-45 with @foreach loop over _parentChain, rendering links with keys and title tooltips\n2. **PONE-64**: Verify CSS classes, accessibility attributes, and tooltip functionality are preserved\n\nIMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:\n- Keep nav element with class=&quot;breadcrumbs&quot; and aria-label=&quot;Breadcrumb&quot;\n- Start with Home link and Project link (unchanged)\n- Loop through _parentChain: for each parent, render &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/workitem/{parent.Id}&quot; title=&quot;{parent.Title}&quot;&amp;gt;{parent.DisplayKey}&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n- Display work item keys (PONE-XX) instead of full titles for cleaner breadcrumb trail\n- Add title=&quot;{work item title}&quot; attribute to all work items for hover tooltips\n- Add &amp;lt;span class=&quot;separator&quot;&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; between all items\n- End with current work item as &amp;lt;span class=&quot;current&quot; title=&quot;{current.Title}&quot;&amp;gt;{current.DisplayKey}&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n- All links use GetDisplayKey(_project.Key) for consistent formatting\n\nDISPLAY EXAMPLE:\n- Shows: Home / P1 / PONE-56 / PONE-57 / PONE-60\n- Hover: &quot;Fix work item breadcrumb hierarchy navigation&quot;, &quot;Implement parent chain traversal logic&quot;, etc.\n\nOUTPUT: Compact breadcrumb trail with work item keys and informative hover tooltips",

Authors write in markdown with live preview, consumers see rendered HTML. Supports headings, bold/italic, code blocks (with syntax highlighting), tables, lists, links, blockquotes, images.\n\n### Architecture\n- **Frontend-only change** — backend stores description/content as plain strings (no DB or API changes)\n- **Markdig** for markdown→HTML conversion\n- **HtmlSanitizer** for XSS protection (whitelist-based, strips script/iframe/event handlers)\n- **Markdown.ColorCode** for code block syntax highlighting (pure .NET, no JavaScript)\n- **Blazor scoped CSS** for markdown styling using existing --rz-* theme variables\n\n### Story dependency chain\n1. **PONE-40** (Foundation) — Installs packages, creates MarkdownRenderer\n2. **PONE-41** (Descriptions) and **PONE-42** (Comments) — Run in parallel after PONE-40\n3. **PONE-43** (Polish) — Syntax highlighting integration\n\n### Files created (4 new)\n- Shared/MarkdownRenderer.razor + .css\n- Shared/MarkdownEditor.razor + .css\n\n### Files modified (5 existing)\n- ProjectManagement.Components.csproj (add Markdig + HtmlSanitizer + Markdown.ColorCode)\n- WorkItems/WorkItemDialog.razor (swap textarea for MarkdownEditor)\n- Comments/CommentEditor.razor + .css (add Write/Preview tabs)\n- Comments/CommentList.razor + .css (swap plain text for MarkdownRenderer)\n- Pages/WorkItemDetail.razor (swap plain text for MarkdownRenderer)\n\n### Technology Replacements (Audit 2026-02-09)\n\n| Original | Replacement | Reason |\n|----------|-------------|--------|\n| Highlight.js (CDN) | Markdown.ColorCode | Pure .NET, runs in Blazor WASM, zero JS |\n| JSInterop cursor manipulation | Manual typing | User has full cursor control via mouse/keyboard |\n| Toolbar formatting buttons | None | Users type markdown manually |\n| Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+B/I/K) | None | No cursor position API without JS |\n| In-app help cheatsheet | External docs | User preference |\n\n### Implementation Impact\n\n**Reduced scope:**\n- 7 new files → 4 new files\n- 7 modified files → 5 modified files\n- Zero JavaScript files created\n- Zero CDN dependencies\n\n**User experience:**\n- Users type markdown manually in Write tab\n- Full cursor control via mouse/HOME/END/arrows\n- Preview tab shows rendered output with syntax highlighting\n- Reference external markdown guides for syntax help\n\n### What&#x27;s Now Available\n\nUsers can:\n- ✅ Write markdown in work item descriptions and comments\n- ✅ Preview markdown before saving (Write/Preview tabs)\n- ✅ View rendered markdown with syntax highlighting (40+ languages)\n- ✅ Use all standard markdown features (headings, lists, tables, links, images, code blocks)\n- ✅ All features work in pure .NET (zero JavaScript)\n\n### Verification\n`just build-cs-components &amp;&amp; just build-cs-wasm`",

      "description": "## ⚠️ TASK OBSOLETE (2026-02-09)\n\n**This task is NO LONGER NEEDED.**\n\n**Why:**\nWe removed HtmlSanitizer entirely from the project due to:\n1. Dependency conflicts with bUnit (testing framework)\n2. Security vulnerabilities in all available versions\n\n**What we&#x27;re doing instead:**\nUsing Markdig&#x27;s built-in `.DisableHtml()` method:\n- Escapes all HTML tags as plain text (no XSS risk)\n- More secure than post-processing sanitization\n- Zero external dependencies\n- Simpler implementation\n\n**For PONE-45 implementation:**\nWhen creating MarkdownRenderer component, use:\n```csharp\nvar pipeline = new MarkdownPipelineBuilder()\n    .DisableHtml()  // ← This replaces all HtmlSanitizer functionality\n    .Build();\n```\n\n**No whitelist configuration needed** - Markdig automatically escapes all HTML.\n\n---\n\n## ORIGINAL PLAN (obsolete)\n\n## PONE-46: Configure HtmlSanitizer whitelist\n\nNOTE: This task is now merged into PONE-45. The MarkdownRenderer component (PONE-45) includes the full sanitizer configuration with CreateSanitizer() method. The whitelist config lives inside the component as a static factory method.\n\n### What the whitelist allows\n**Tags**: h1-h6, p, a, strong, em, br, hr, img, del, pre, code, blockquote, table/thead/tbody/tr/th/td, ul/ol/li\n**Attributes**: class (for code highlighting), href (links), src/alt/title (images)\n**Schemes**: https, http only (no javascript: or data: URIs)\n\n### What the whitelist blocks\n- script, iframe, object, embed, form, input\n- Event handler attributes (onclick, onerror, onload, etc.)\n- javascript: and data: URI schemes\n- Any tag/attribute not explicitly whitelisted\n\n### Verification\nThis is verified as part of PONE-45. Can be independently tested by passing XSS payloads to MarkdownRenderer:\n- `&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert(1)&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;` → stripped entirely\n- `&amp;lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&amp;gt;` → onerror attribute stripped\n- `[link](javascript:alert(1))` → javascript: scheme blocked",

Add component tests for parent chain building logic. Test navigation through breadcrumb links. Verify breadcrumbs update when navigating between work items.\n\nTASK SUMMARY:\n1. **PONE-65**: Verify work items with no parents display correctly (empty parent chain)\n2. **PONE-66**: Verify missing parents in cache are handled gracefully (partial chain shown)\n3. **PONE-67**: Add unit tests for BuildParentChain (3-level, 2-level, 1-level, no parent, missing parent)\n4. **PONE-68**: Integration testing - create full hierarchy, test navigation, verify breadcrumb updates\n\nEDGE CASES COVERED:\n- ParentId = null → returns empty list, breadcrumb shows only current item\n- GetById(ParentId) returns null → stops traversal, logs warning, shows partial chain\n- Different hierarchy depths: Epic only, Epic&amp;gt;Story, Epic&amp;gt;Story&amp;gt;Task\n- Navigation between items → breadcrumb updates dynamically\n- Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility\n\nTESTING APPROACH:\n- Unit tests in ProjectManagement.Components.Tests/Pages/WorkItemDetailTests.cs\n- Mock AppState with test work item hierarchies\n- Verify BuildParentChain returns correct order and count\n- Integration tests create real hierarchy in UI, verify breadcrumb rendering and navigation\n\nOUTPUT: Comprehensive test coverage ensuring robust breadcrumb behavior",

All data already cached in AppState, just need to walk parent chain using ParentId. Zero performance impact - O(depth) where depth = 3-4 max. Frontend-only change in WorkItemDetail.razor.\n\n## Backend Protection (IMPORTANT)\n\n**Circular references are IMPOSSIBLE in production data:**\n- Backend validates parent changes in `backend/crates/pm-ws/src/handlers/work_item.rs:586-634`\n- `check_circular_reference` function walks parent chain before accepting parent updates\n- MAX_DEPTH = 100 on backend prevents excessively deep hierarchies\n- Any attempt to create A→B→C→A cycle is REJECTED server-side with validation error\n\n**Frontend Implementation:**\n- NO cycle detection needed (backend guarantees data integrity)\n- Simple MAX_DEPTH = 20 limit for defensive programming only\n- Handles edge cases: missing parents, race conditions, corrupted state\n- Uses ILogger for warnings, not Console.WriteLine\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n**Stories:**\n1. **PONE-57**: Parent chain traversal logic (BuildParentChain method with depth limit)\n2. **PONE-58**: Breadcrumb rendering HTML (loop through parents, show keys with title tooltips)\n3. **PONE-59**: Edge cases and tests (depth limit, missing parents, integration tests)\n\n**Breadcrumb Display:**\n- Shows work item keys (PONE-57) instead of full titles for compact display\n- Hover tooltips show full titles (title=&quot;{work item title}&quot; attribute)\n- Example: Home / P1 / PONE-56 / PONE-57 / PONE-60\n- All parent links clickable, current item non-clickable with class=&quot;current&quot;\n\n**Performance:**\n- O(depth) where depth ≤ 4 typical, ≤ 20 enforced by frontend limit\n- All lookups from in-memory AppState cache\n- Zero DB queries, zero WebSocket calls\n- Breadcrumb updates dynamically on navigation",

      "description": "## Problem\n\nThe pm-cli `work-item update` command has no `--position` flag. The position field exists in the database (`pm_work_items.position` INTEGER) and is returned in API responses, but cannot be set via the CLI.\n\nThis forced a direct SQLite hack during PONE-39 audit to reorder tasks by implementation priority.\n\n## Scope\n\nAdd `--position &amp;lt;INT&amp;gt;` as an optional parameter to `pm work-item update`. Should follow the same patterns as `--story-points` (optional integer, passed through to the update request).\n\n## Likely touchpoints\n- `pm-cli` argument parsing (clap struct for work-item update)\n- `UpdateWorkItemRequest` protobuf message (may need a new field)\n- Backend handler for work item updates (pm-ws or pm-api)\n- Position validation (non-negative integer)\n\n## Out of scope (for now)\n- Drag-and-drop reordering (bulk position updates)\n- Auto-gapping positions (e.g., positions 10, 20, 30 for easy insertion)\n- Position constraints (uniqueness within parent)",
