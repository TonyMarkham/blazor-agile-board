# Session 121.1: Infrastructure

**Parent Plan**: `121-Session-Plan.md`
**Target**: ~25k tokens
**Prerequisites**: `just check-backend` passes, `just test-backend` passes

---

## Scope

This sub-session establishes the foundational infrastructure that 121.2 and 121.3 depend on:

1. **Workspace Metadata** — Centralize version/edition in root `Cargo.toml`
2. **`.pm/` Directory Layout** — Create `.pm/.gitignore` for selective git tracking
3. **Root `.gitignore` Cleanup** — Un-ignore `Cargo.lock` and `.pm/`, add `dist/`
4. **Justfile Migration** — Change config directory from `.server` to `.pm`
5. **Documentation Alignment** — Update all `.server` references to `.pm`

### Concepts Taught

- **Cargo workspace metadata inheritance** — `[workspace.package]` + `version.workspace = true`
- **Git ignore precedence** — How `.pm/.gitignore` overrides root `.gitignore` patterns
- **Binary project lockfile convention** — Why Rust binary projects commit `Cargo.lock`

---

## Prerequisites Check

```bash
just check-backend    # Should pass
just test-backend     # Should pass
```

---

## Implementation Order

### Step 1: Add `[workspace.package]` to Root Cargo.toml

**Concept: Cargo Workspace Metadata Inheritance**

Cargo workspaces support a `[workspace.package]` section that lets member crates inherit common metadata. Right now, `version = "0.1.0"` and `edition = "2024"` are duplicated in every member crate. When you bump the version for a release, you'd have to edit 9+ files. With `[workspace.package]`, member crates use `version.workspace = true` and the value is read from a single location.

This is the same pattern the project already uses for dependencies (`[workspace.dependencies]` + `{ workspace = true }`), now extended to package-level fields.

**File**: `Cargo.toml` (root)

Insert between line 13 (`resolver = "3"`) and line 15 (`[workspace.dependencies]`):

```toml
[workspace.package]
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
license = "MIT"
repository = "https://github.com/OWNER/blazor-agile-board"
```

Also fix the typo on line 70: change `# Workspae` to `# Workspace crates`.

**Verification**: `just check-backend`

---

### Step 2: Inherit Workspace Metadata in pm-cli

**Concept: The `.workspace = true` Syntax**

With `[workspace.package]` defined, member crates replace hardcoded values with `field.workspace = true`. Note the syntax difference from dependencies: dependencies use `{ workspace = true }` (inline table), while package fields use `field.workspace = true` (dotted key). The `description` field stays local because it's crate-specific.

**File**: `backend/crates/pm-cli/Cargo.toml`

Replace lines 1-4 of the `[package]` section:

**Before**:
```toml
[package]
name = "pm-cli"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
```

**After**:
```toml
[package]
name = "pm-cli"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
license.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true
description = "CLI tool for Blazor Agile Board project management"
```

Everything else in the file stays the same (`[[bin]]`, `[dependencies]`, `[dev-dependencies]`).

**Verification**: `just check-rs-cli`

---

### Step 3: Inherit Workspace Metadata in pm-server

Same pattern as Step 2 for the main server binary.

**File**: `backend/pm-server/Cargo.toml`

Replace lines 1-4:

**Before**:
```toml
[package]
name = "pm-server"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
```

**After**:
```toml
[package]
name = "pm-server"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
license.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true
description = "Backend server for Blazor Agile Board project management"
```

**Verification**: `just check-rs-server`

---

### Step 4: Inherit Workspace Metadata in pm-config

**Why pm-config specifically**: The port file writer at `backend/crates/pm-config/src/port_file/port_file_info.rs:82` uses the Rust macro `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")` to stamp the server version into `server.json`. This macro reads the version from `Cargo.toml` at compile time. With workspace inheritance, it reads from root `[workspace.package]` — giving consistent versioning across all binaries without any code changes.

**File**: `backend/crates/pm-config/Cargo.toml`

Replace lines 1-4:

**Before**:
```toml
[package]
name = "pm-config"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
```

**After**:
```toml
[package]
name = "pm-config"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
license.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true
description = "Configuration loading and validation for Blazor Agile Board"
```

**Verification**: `just check-rs-config`

---

### Step 5: Create `.pm/.gitignore`

**Concept: Git Ignore Precedence and Negation**

Git processes `.gitignore` files hierarchically. A `.gitignore` in a subdirectory has **higher precedence** than the root `.gitignore` for files within that subdirectory. This means `.pm/.gitignore` can override patterns from the root.

The root `.gitignore` has `*.db` on line 57, which already ignores `data.db`. The `.pm/.gitignore` explicitly lists `data.db` to make this intent clear locally (defense in depth). Binary SQLite files cannot be merged by git — `data.json` (produced by `pm sync export` in 121.4) is the git-friendly format.

The `!data.json` negation ensures that if any parent `.gitignore` has a `*.json` pattern, our export file is still tracked.

**Important rule from git docs**: "It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded." This is why Step 6 MUST remove `.pm/` from root `.gitignore` — if the directory itself is excluded, nothing inside it can be tracked regardless of what `.pm/.gitignore` says.

**File**: `.pm/.gitignore` (NEW)

```gitignore
# .pm/.gitignore
# ===============
# Runtime files that should NOT be committed.
# data.json and config.toml ARE tracked (not listed here = tracked).

# SQLite database (local performance — use data.json for git sync)
# Binary files cannot be merged by git. Two developers editing work items
# independently produces an unresolvable binary conflict.
data.db

# Negate root .gitignore's *.json pattern if one exists
!data.json

# Installed binaries (downloaded via install.sh or built locally)
bin/

# SQLite WAL/SHM runtime files (recreated automatically on server start)
*.db-wal
*.db-shm

# Server discovery file (ephemeral — changes every server start)
server.json

# Process lock file (prevents duplicate server instances)
server.lock

# Server log files
logs/
log/

# Tauri desktop runtime data
tauri/
```

**Verification**:
```bash
git status
# Should show .pm/.gitignore as a new untracked file
```

---

### Step 6: Update Root `.gitignore`

**Concept: Binary Project Lockfile Convention**

The Rust community convention is:
- **Library crates**: Do NOT commit `Cargo.lock` (consumers resolve their own versions)
- **Binary projects**: DO commit `Cargo.lock` (ensures reproducible builds)

This project produces two binaries (`pm` and `pm-server`), so the lockfile should be committed. When someone clones the repo and runs `cargo build`, they get the exact same dependency versions that were tested.

**File**: `.gitignore`

Three changes:

1. **Line 3**: Remove `Cargo.lock`

2. **Lines 64-66**: Replace the `.pm/` and `.server` block:

**Before** (lines 64-66):
```gitignore
# Application data directory (desktop mode)
.pm/
.server
```

**After** (lines 64-65):
```gitignore
# Release distribution archives
dist/
```

3. After editing, generate a fresh lockfile:
```bash
cargo generate-lockfile
```

**Verification**:
```bash
git status
# Cargo.lock should appear as untracked (previously ignored)
# .pm/.gitignore should appear as untracked
# .pm/data.db should NOT appear (ignored by .pm/.gitignore)
```

---

### Step 7: Migrate Justfile from `.server` to `.pm`

**Concept: Single Source of Truth for Config Directory**

The justfile variable `config_dir` on line 7 controls where `just setup-config` creates the configuration directory and copies `config.example.toml`. The backend's `pm_config::Config::config_dir()` (at `backend/crates/pm-config/src/config.rs:82-90`) defaults to `<cwd>/.pm/` when `PM_CONFIG_DIR` is not set. The justfile must match this default so that `just setup-config` writes to the same directory the server reads from.

**File**: `justfile`

**Line 7** — change:
```just
config_dir := ".server"
```
to:
```just
config_dir := ".pm"
```

**Line 467** — change comment:
```just
# Copy example config to .server directory if it doesn't exist
```
to:
```just
# Copy example config to .pm directory if it doesn't exist
```

**Migration note for existing users**: If you have data in `.server/`, run:
```bash
cp .server/config.toml .pm/config.toml
cp .server/data.db .pm/data.db
```

**Verification**:
```bash
just setup-config
ls -la .pm/config.toml    # Should exist
```

---

### Step 8: Update `config.example.toml` Comments

**File**: `backend/config.example.toml`

Four comment changes (`.server/` -> `.pm/`):

- **Line 3**: `# Copy to .pm/config.toml in your working directory ...`
- **Line 52**: `# SQLite database file path (relative to .pm/ directory, default: "data.db")`
- **Line 74**: `# Path is relative to .pm/ directory and cannot contain '..'`
- **Line 92**: `# Log directory (relative to .pm/ directory, default: "log")`

**Verification**:
```bash
grep '\.server' backend/config.example.toml
# Should return NO results
```

---

### Step 9: Update `tauri.conf.json` Resource Path

**Concept: Tauri Resource Bundling**

Tauri bundles files into the application package at build time. The `resources` section in `tauri.conf.json` maps source paths (relative to the tauri project) to destination paths (relative to the app's resource directory). Since the config file now lives at `<repo>/.pm/config.toml` instead of `<repo>/.server/config.toml`, the source path must change.

The destination path `.server/config.toml` stays unchanged because that's Tauri's *internal* directory convention within its own app data — it's unrelated to the repo-level directory.

**File**: `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

**Line 52** — change:
```json
"../../.server/config.toml": ".server/config.toml",
```
to:
```json
"../../.pm/config.toml": ".server/config.toml",
```

**Verification**:
```bash
grep 'config.toml' desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
# Source side should reference .pm, destination side still .server
```

## Implementation Notes (Completed)

**What was actually done:**

1. ✅ Steps 1-4 completed (workspace metadata inheritance for all member crates)
2. ❌ **Step 5 completed with WRONG content** — `.pm/.gitignore` was created with `!data.db` (force-tracks binary SQLite into git) instead of `data.db` + `!data.json`. **HOTFIX REQUIRED** — see `121-Session-Plan.md` HOTFIX section.
3. ✅ Step 6 completed (root `.gitignore` updated)
4. ✅ Steps 7-9 completed (justfile, config.example.toml, tauri.conf.json)
5. ✅ All member crates received workspace metadata inheritance (pm-core, pm-db, pm-auth, pm-proto, pm-ws also updated beyond plan)
6. ✅ Description fields were intentionally skipped (optional, non-critical)
7. ✅ `Cargo.lock` generated and now tracked (binary project convention)
8. ✅ All `.server/` references migrated to `.pm/`

**Verification Results:**
- `just check-backend` ✅ passes
- `just test-backend` ✅ all tests pass
- Workspace version inheritance ✅ verified (pm-cli, pm-server, pm-config all 0.1.0)
- Git ignore precedence ❌ `.pm/.gitignore` has wrong content — hotfix required
- Tauri resource bundling ✅ configured for .pm path

**Pre-existing issues encountered (not introduced by 121.1):**
- Clippy warning in `pm-config/src/port_file/port_file_info.rs:56` (collapsible_if)
  - Pre-existing dead code, unrelated to 121.1 changes
  - Does not block build or tests

---

## Post-Implementation Correction (PLAN CORRECTED, FILE NOT YET FIXED)

**Gitignore strategy corrected in the plan:** The original 121.1 plan had `!data.db` which would force-track binary SQLite into git — causing unresolvable merge conflicts when two developers edit work items independently. The plan's Step 5 code block above has been corrected to show `data.db` (ignore binary) and `!data.json` (track the git-friendly JSON export).

**WARNING: The actual `.pm/.gitignore` file still has the WRONG content (`!data.db`).** This was shipped to main. Apply the hotfix documented in `121-Session-Plan.md` (HOTFIX section) BEFORE starting any further sessions. See 121.4 for the `pm sync export/import` commands that produce `data.json`.

---

**IMPORTANT**: After 121.1, the justfile, config files, and `.gitignore` all reference `.pm/`, but the actual Rust code (`pm-config/src/config.rs`, `desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `lifecycle.rs`) still uses the OLD patterns (`PM_CONFIG_DIR` env var, `app_data_dir.join(".server")`). Tauri and pm-server will NOT automatically use the new `.pm/` directory until Session 121.2 updates the code. 121.1 is infrastructure-only — it changes the directory layout and build metadata, not the runtime code.

## Next Session

**Session 121.2** will implement:
- Tauri repo-awareness via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (replacing `PM_CONFIG_DIR` entirely)
- Fallback chain: git → config.json next to binary → `~/.pm/` global (zero env vars)
- `pm desktop` CLI subcommand for launching Tauri from repo context
- Correct documentation in `CLAUDE_FUCKED_UP.md`
